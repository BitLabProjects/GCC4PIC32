*************    PIC32 GCC framework    ***************
****     By Bruno Basseto (bruno@wise-ware.org)    ****

This simple framework can be used to build Microchip PIC32 applications 
with the MIPS-GCC-newlib toolchain.

Files:

/build
sample makefile, to automatize the compiling process.

/include
contains header files specific for PIC32 registers, 
configuration bits and interrupt definitions.

/lib
contains crt.o source code specific for PIC32 
initialization and special function register allocation 
in memory. 

/ld
contains linker scripts for distributing objects into 
PIC32 memory.

/bin
contains helper scripts for testing compiled ELF files and 
translating them into physical-addressed Intel-HEX files.
